# obiscraper

**Introduction**

This tool submits logical or physical queries by scraping the Oracle Business Intelligence analytics portal and returns the result as R Data Frame.

This is basically a convenient interface to Selenium for web scraping the OBI portal. This package will also take care of the login form.

When submitting a logical query, obiscraper uses the Oracle Business Intelligence GO URL in order to download the output as a text file in your temp folder. Then this text file is parsed in R and converted into a Data Frame.

When submitting a physical SQL query, obiscraper creates a narrative view based on that query and then extracts the content from the page.

**Dependencies**

Firefox
